## Description

I created a weather dashboard. There's a search button where users can search for a city to view the weather forecast. My tutor and I had some trouble with accessing the correct API for free, and I wasn't able to get the UV index data. Instead, I created easily translatable functionality for the temperature value, which changes colors based on the value. Another issue was that I couldn't access a five-day forecast with this API, only five three-hour window forecasts. I figured I would do it this way to demonstrate the functionality.


I added some light CSS to make it more appealing to users. When a city is searched, a button is added below the search bar so they can access a past search easily. I had many issues trying to implement the functionality of these buttons, and I will be fixing them during my next tutoring session.
